# Video-Super-Resolution

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to recover a high-resolution video from a given low-resolution video. The main motivation behind this project is that we would be able to restore old videos which are in lower resolution to higher resolution videos. This will help make it a more comfortable experience for the viewers to watch the video.

Please refer Latex-Report for detailed report, graphs and detalied analysis.
